# Azure CLI for Azure IoT

The Azure Command Line Interface ([Azure CLI](/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli)) is a set of commands used to create and manage Azure resources.  It is available across many Azure services including Azure IoT.  There are over 100 references for Azure IoT giving you the ability to work effectively with IoT services from a command line.

## References for IoT

The Azure IoT CLI experience is composed of two parts: Azure CLI (commonly referred to as CLI **core**) and the Azure IoT CLI **extension**.

IoT functionality in Azure CLI **core** is focused on infrastructure management and configuration. IoT Hub CRUD operations, or configuring IoT Hub message routes are typical use cases for core commands.

The IoT **extension** introduces rich features and functionality to manage, manipulate and interact with the data, entities and objects on the infrastructure itself. For example managing fleets of devices, monitoring device-to-cloud events and invoking cloud to device methods are all enabled via the IoT extension. The Azure IoT extension for Azure CLI unlocks the use of experimental or pre-release technology contributing to its versatility in a variety of scenarios and use cases.

### Core reference commands

### Extension reference installation

Azure CLI extension references must be installed prior to use.  Use the [az extension add](/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview) command to install an extension reference by name.  Find out more about extension references in [Use extensions with Azure CLI](/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).

```azurecli
# install the Azure CLI extension reference for Azure IoT
az extension add --name azure-iot
```

## Azure CLI reference examples

Examples are provided with every Azure CLI reference. Although you can also complete these tasks through the Azure portal, using the Azure CLI requires a single command line.  Here are a few code blocks to give you an idea of how easy it is to use the Azure CLI.

To work with Azure IoT, you'll first need a resource group.  Azure resource groups are simple to create and manage with the Azure CLI.  

```azurecli
#create a resource group
az group create -location westus -name MyResourceGroup
```

```azurecli
#get a list of resource groups for a subscription
az group list --subscription MySubscription --output table
```

It is as straightforward to create an Azure IoT Hub in the '''westus''' region in the standard pricing tier.

```azurecli
#create an Azure IoT hub
az iot hub create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name MyIotHub --location westus
```
